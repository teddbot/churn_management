Churn Management Project: A Beginner-Friendly Guide
Introduction
Hey! Today, I’m going to walk you through a cool project where we built a system that helps companies understand which of their customers might leave (or "churn"). Not only that, but this system also suggests ways to keep them around by offering personalized deals and messages. We'll explain how we set this up on a MacBook M1 laptop, step-by-step, in simple language.

Ready? Let’s break this down!

Part 1: What's This Project About?
Imagine you have a bunch of customers using your app or service. Some of them might stop using it, which isn’t good for business. Our project is designed to predict which customers might leave and give them special offers to convince them to stay. We built this system on a MacBook M1 and made it work entirely offline, right on our laptop.

Part 2: Setting Up the Tools We Need
Since we were working on a MacBook M1, which is a bit different from other laptops, we had to do some setup before starting:

We used something called Miniforge, which helps us manage different software tools. Think of it like a toolbox that makes sure all the parts work well together.
Then, we created a special “workspace” on the laptop using Miniforge. In this workspace, we installed a few tools:
Pandas: A tool for organizing and handling data.
Scikit-Learn: This is what we used to build a model that predicts which customers might leave.
Yagmail: Helps us send email reports easily.
By setting up this workspace, we made sure everything we needed was ready to go!

Part 3: How Our System Works
Now, let’s talk about what our system actually does. We broke the project into four main tasks:

1. Predicting Who Might Leave
We fed our system a bunch of customer data (like how often they use the service and how much they spend) to train it to spot patterns.
Then, it uses this pattern to predict which customers are likely to stop using the service.

2. Offering Special Deals to Keep Them
Once our system predicts who might leave, it assigns them a special offer or discount to encourage them to stay.
We looked at each customer's spending and chose the best deal we could offer without hurting the company’s revenue.

3. Sending a Personalized Message
Initially, we thought about using an advanced AI model to create friendly, personalized messages for each customer. However, since we did not have access to a paid AI model in time, we decided to keep things simple.
Instead, we now use a default, friendly message for all customers, which says:
"Dear subscriber, we have an exclusive offer just for you: [Offer Name]! Stay connected with us for more amazing benefits."

4. Measuring How Well It Works
Next, we wanted to see if our offers were working. To do this, we added a part that simulates whether a customer accepts the offer. For now, this is a random “yes” or “no” since we don’t have real customer responses.
The system then calculates some key numbers:
Retention Rate: How many customers we managed to keep?
Accepted Offers: How many people took up our deals?
Average Spending: How much these customers spend after accepting our offers.

5. Real-Time Reporting via Email
Finally, we set up the system to send an email report with all the results. The email includes how many offers were sent, how many were accepted, and the retention rate. It also attaches an Excel file with all the details so it’s easy to review.
Part 4: Running It on Our Laptop
After setting everything up, we can run everything right on our laptop. Here’s how it works:

We open our terminal (like the command center on our laptop).
Type the command:

python main.py

The system runs through the whole process:

Predicts who might leave.
Assigns offers.
Creates friendly messages.
Measures if the intervention worked.
Sends a detailed email report.


Key Takeaways
We made a system that helps keep customers from leaving by predicting churn and offering special deals.
We send a friendly message to communicate effectively to customers.
The system measures the success of these offers and sends a real-time report via email.
